# PacManDQN
In this project, we will be addressing a machine learning methodology called "Reinforcement Learning" in order
to create a bot that can play PacMan.

The framework that we will use is called Tensorflow made by Google and the Unity Engine's framework for training
a dataset in order to learn how to play PacMan by itself. After training the dataset provided (generated by the
bot playing with itself), it will be imported into Unity in order to easily create the Game Mechanics and test
out the ML Agents Framework provided by the Unity Engine.

## What Do You Need To Run The Code?
To run the code, you need the following
* Python 3.5 or higher
* Unity Engine
* Tensorflow (available by using pip)
